# Udacity_ALX-Nanodegree-Data-Analyst-Investigate-a-Dataset-Project
For this project, I have selected the No_Show dataset which contains information about 100k medical appointments in Brazil. The dataset is focused on the question whether or not patients show up for their apppintments. Each row contains a number of features for each patient. Some of them are ‘ScheduledDay’, which depicts the day the patient set up their appointment, ‘Neighborhood’, which indicates the location of the hospital, and ‘Scholarship’, which indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
The questions to be explored are:
  Question 1: Is there any relationship between age and showing up or missing appointments?
  Question 2: Is there any relationship between gender and showing up or missing appointments?
  Question 3: Is there any relationship between neighborhood and showing up or missing appointments?
  Question 4: Is there any relationship between patient being on scholarship and showing up or missing appointments?
  Question 5: What kind of diseases are present more among the patients who miss their appointment?
  Question 6: Does receiving an SMS play any role among the group that showed up for their appointment?
